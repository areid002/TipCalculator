## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

There are quite a few issues with running the app on Simulator. 
This could be due to the fact that my MacBook is an older model, but the Simulator screen stays black with the Apple symbol.
It works better when the app is run on my iPhone.
This issue also prevents me from using LiceCap to present the walkthrough of the app as required.
